# Welcome to gtk4-nvidia-monitor-rust contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started making contributions:

- [Bug Issue Template](https://github.com/derenv/gtk4-nvidia-monitor-rust/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)
- [Feature Request Issue Template](https://github.com/derenv/gtk4-nvidia-monitor-rust/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
- [Pull Request (PR) Template]()

## Getting started

Check out the open issues [here](https://github.com/derenv/gtk4-nvidia-monitor-rust/issues)

Issues tagged "good first issue" and "help wanted" are your best bet - otherwise open a feature request issue and we can discuss changes!

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a bug or want a new feature, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/derenv/gtk4-nvidia-monitor-rust/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/derenv/gtk4-nvidia-monitor-rust/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/derenv/gtk4-nvidia-monitor-rust/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Install or update to **Rust 1.66.0**. All dependancies are in the Cargo.toml file, and will be compiled when you build the project

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada:

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be part of next release.
